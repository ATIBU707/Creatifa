        <div class="Uganda">Uganda is a country of rich cultural heritage, where art and craft have been an integral part of daily life for centuries. 
            From traditional dance and music to intricate beadwork and basket weaving, Ugandan artistry is a vibrant reflection of the country's diverse cultures and traditions. 
            At Craftoria, we are proud to showcase the talent and creativity of Ugandan artisans, offering a platform for them to share their work with the world. 
            Our collection features a wide range of handcrafted products, from colorful textiles and pottery to unique sculptures and jewelry. 
            Each piece is a labor of love, crafted with care and attention to detail by skilled artisans who take pride in their work.
